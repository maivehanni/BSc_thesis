\chapter{Conclusion}

In this study the Rt\_IFO0880\_LEBp2023 model was found to predict \textit{Rhodotorula torluoides} intracellular fluxes of lipogenesis precursors most accurately.
This model has cytosolic malate dehydrogenase and thus is able to predict the flux of ACL, which from omics studies has been found to be present in \textit{R. torluoides}.

Still, the autohor of the enhanced model of Rt\_IFO0880 named Rt\_IFO0880\_LEBp2023, has pointed out that the improvements that resulted in the Rt\_IFO0880\_LEBp2023 
model cover only a small portion of the metabolism of \textit{R. torluoides}. The differences are possibly the "tip of the iceberg" of many others and
the differences between the existing GEMs of \textit{R. toruloides} are significant and may lead to different understandings of
this yeast's physiology if used alone. \cite{DeBiaggi2023}

For better prediction of \textit{R. toruloides} phenotype there is a need for a consensus GEM. (It is currently being reconstructed by ...)
