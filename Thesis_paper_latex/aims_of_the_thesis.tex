\chapter{Aims of the thesis}

The objective of the study is investigating \textit{R. toruloides} lipogenesis
focused central carbon metabolism based on a comparison between the four GEMs of \textit{R. toruloides}.
For that FBA is carried out with all of the models using different objective functions and constraints. 
The intracellular fluxes of PPP and TCA enzymes are compared between the models to understand the main 
sources of lipid precursors acetyl-CoA and NADPH within these models.
