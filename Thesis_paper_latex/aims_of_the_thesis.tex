\chapter{Aims of the thesis}

The objective of the study is investigating \textit{R. toruloides} lipogenesis
focused central carbon metabolism based on a comparison between the four genome-scale metabolic models of \textit{R. toruloides}.
For that, flux balance analysis is carried out with all of the models using different:

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep, label=(\roman*)]
    \item constraints, such as the specific glucose uptake $r_{glu}$ and the specific growth rate $\mu$, and
    \item objective functions, such as biomass maximisation and non-growth associated maintenance reaction minimisation.
\end{enumerate}

The intracellular fluxes of pentose phosphate pathway and citric acid cycle enzymes are predicted by these models to understand the main sources of lipid precursors, acetyl-CoA and NADPH, within these models.
