\chapter{Aims of the thesis}

The objective of the study is investigating \textit{R. toruloides} lipogenesis
focused central carbon metabolism based on a comparison between the four genome-scale metabolic models of \textit{R. toruloides}.
For that, flux balance analysis is carried out with all of the models using different objective functions and constraints. 
The intracellular fluxes of pentose phosphate pathway and citric acid cycle enzymes are compared between the models to understand the main sources of lipid precursors, acetyl-CoA and NADPH, within these models.
