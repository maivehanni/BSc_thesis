\chapter{Results}

% Characterizing flux differences 
% (Key figures: e.g. scatter plots, simulated flux maps, simulated enzyme usage distribution, if using total proteome ec-model)

% Describe the fluxes in central carbon metabolism of R. toruloides;
% Test forcing the flux through XPK and ACL and see what changes;
% Extract cofactor balances and analyze what makes model to prefer one or the other.

% Results Section 1. A figure panel with A: brief metabolic map; B: exchange fluxes;
% C: main intracellular fluxes. Different GRs on x acis will give you a line chart instead 
% of a bar chart, which I think is more informative
