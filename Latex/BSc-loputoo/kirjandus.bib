Physically such a model equation describes longitudinal waves (density change) in biomembranes which have an internal structure composed by lipid molecules. The possible solutions are constructed and analysed. The phase plane analysis and numerical simulation reveal a novel phenomenon: the possible existence of a soliton doublet.},
